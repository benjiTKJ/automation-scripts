## Purpose

- As a developer working in 2022, i found myself constantly keeping the work laptop at sleep mode instead of shutting it down :zombie: so that the moment i open it i could continue on my progress from yesterday. However i found that i opened too many tabs and my work laptop (windows) was getting slower and slower :snail:.
- I was thinking, what if i could close everything at end of each work day, while immediately opening to a fresh laptop with only required tabs/applications.
- I looked around and found out that i could run bash scripts :clipboard: that could open the tabs/applications that i wanted, combining with task scheduler :stopwatch: , that could fulfil my use case.
- Hence i created this repo as a way to help me automate, as well as potentially help others as well.

## Rules

1) Script or tools should be around ways to automate task, whether with a cron job or not

2) Task need to solve a problem statement

3) No need to be platform/os agnostic

## Potential plans

- automate running on mac, similarly to windows

## Problem statements

### Problem statement 1

- laptop (windows) is getting slower and slower because of not shutting down daily and chrome tabs are pilling up more and more.

### Problem statement 2

- During restart of laptop, state of laptop starts from nothing (all tabs closed etc), hence need time to open them one by one so i can resume work.

## Solutions

### Bash
